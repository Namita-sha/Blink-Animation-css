👁️ Blinking Eye Animation with HTML & CSS

This project demonstrates a simple blinking eye animation using pure HTML and CSS. It uses two images — one for the open eye and one for the wide eye and alternates between them using `@keyframes`.

🎯 Features

- Smooth eye-blink animation
- centered layout
- Pure CSS-based animation (no JavaScript)
- Clean and minimal styling with dark background

 How It Works

- A `div` with class `.blink` displays the open eye using `background-image`.
- The `@keyframes blink` animation periodically swaps the background image to a closed eye.
- The timing is controlled to simulate a natural blinking rhythm.
